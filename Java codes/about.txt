 - This is a project to develop myself in Java.
 - I'm planning to bring the idea to GUI anytime soon.
 - Basically, we have a Checking Account and a Saving Accout.
   The Checking Account has credit of 15% based on salary
   (if only costumer is 18 years old or older than AND
   earn salary greater than R$1000).
 - The credit can be used withdrawing more than the actual 
   account balance.
 - I made this suddenly, so I will develop better later.
